# Installable workflows

Markdown here is what other repositories install:

```bash
gh aw add svennijhuis/agentic-workflows/<file-stem>@v1.0.0
```

Each file **must** have an `on:` trigger. Kebab-case stem becomes the `gh aw add` id.

Block 1: catalog workflows are **`workflow_dispatch` only** until Sven enables more ([POL25](../policies/POL25.yml)). Each workflow sets cost caps, permissions, and network in frontmatter. Commit `.lock.yml` next to each `.md` (`make compile`). Each workflow has an agent card `<name>.card.yml` next to it: interface, harness, engine, tools, MCP transport and secret NAMES ([harness model](../docs/explanation/harness-model.md)).

| Workflow | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [squad-review.md](squad-review.md) | Legacy PR review adapter (removed when F01 ships) |

Shared fragments: [shared/](shared/). Authoring: [.github/instructions/aw.instructions.md](../.github/instructions/aw.instructions.md). Verify: `make verify`.
